<h2 style="color:red;">GLOBAL FIXES (Apply to ALL Ads)</h2>
<p style="color:red;"><b>FIX #1:</b> Company name is misspelled throughout Ads 1-8 as "foundation Land Co" — correct name is <b>"Foundational Land Co"</b> (capital F, include the "-al"). Ads 9-10 have it right. Please fix all instances.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>FIX #2:</b> Ad #9 says "We don't wholesale it. We don't flip contracts." — Please remove this line. Replace with: <i>"When we make you an offer, it's backed by real capital and real buyer relationships."</i></p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>FIX #3:</b> Ad #7 says "We buy &amp; help develop land. That's it." — Change to: <i>"We buy vacant land. That's it."</i></p>

<h2>Ad #1 – Inherited Land</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> If you inherited land you never asked for — and now you're stuck figuring out what to do with it — this is for you.</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> Inherited land comes with a lot you didn't plan for.</p>
<p>Property taxes. Insurance. Figuring out boundaries. Coordinating with family. Maybe even a trip to a property you've never seen and have no use for.</p>
<p>The last thing you need is a long, complicated sale process with no guarantee it even closes.</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we specifically help landowners sell vacant parcels — not houses, not rentals — just land.</p>
<p>That's all we do.</p>
<p>Our team takes the time to understand your situation, answer your questions about the property, and walk you through your options at your pace — without pressure to rush into a decision.</p>
<p>Because we work directly with builders and developers, we know what land is actually worth in today's market — not just what Zillow says.</p>
<p>You won't need to clear the property. No survey required. No improvements or clean-up. We buy land as-is.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs, charge no commissions, and the offer you accept is exactly what you walk away with.</p>
<p>If you've inherited land and want a simple, straightforward way to sell it for cash — without the headaches —</p>

<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS: Ad #1 is solid. Only fix is company name. ✅]</b></p>
<hr>

<h2>Ad #2 – Property Tax Burden</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> Paying property taxes every year on land you don't use, don't visit, and have no plans to build on?</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> That $500, $1,500, maybe $3,000+ every year isn't building equity. It's not generating income. It's just... gone.</p>
<p>And next year? Same thing.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS — ADD after "And next year? Same thing.":]</b><br><i>"Meanwhile, builders in your area are actively buying land right now — and paying top dollar for it. Your land may be worth more today than it will be a year from now."</i></p>
<p>If you own vacant land and you're tired of watching money disappear into a property that does nothing for you — there's a simpler option.</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly from owners like you.</p>
<p>We're not a traditional real estate company. We don't list properties or charge commissions. We specifically focus on helping landowners turn unused parcels into cash — quickly and cleanly.</p>
<p>Our team will analyze your property, explain exactly how we determine our offer based on local builder demand and recent sales, and give you a written cash offer within 48 hours.</p>
<p>No clearing required. No surveys. No improvements. We buy land as-is.</p>
<p>You pick the closing date — as soon as 14 days or on your timeline.</p>
<p>And the offer you agree to is the exact amount you receive at closing. No surprises. No fees.</p>
<p><b>CTA:</b> If you're done paying taxes on land that gives you nothing back, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with Foundational Land Co. We'll review your parcel and show you exactly what it's worth in today's market.</p>

<h2>Ad #3 – Out-of-State Owner</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> Do you own vacant land but live out of state — and not sure what to do with it?</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> You're not alone.</p>
<p>A lot of landowners hold onto parcels for years thinking they'll eventually do something with them. Build a cabin. Retire there. Pass it down.</p>
<p>But life changes. Plans shift. And now you're paying property taxes on land that's far away — land you can't easily check on, maintain, or even remember the last time you visited.</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we work specifically with out-of-state landowners who want a clean, simple exit.</p>
<p>We handle everything remotely. You don't need to visit the property. You don't need to hire someone to clear it or survey it. We buy land as-is — in whatever condition it's in right now.</p>
<p>Our team has years of experience closing land deals and working with builders and developers. We can give you a realistic cash offer based on actual demand — not guesswork.</p>
<p>Within 48 hours of our first conversation, you'll have a written offer in hand.</p>
<p>No commissions. No closing costs. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>The number we agree on is the number you receive.</p>
<p><b>CTA:</b> If you're ready to stop managing land from a distance, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation cash offer consultation with Foundational Land Co. We'll handle everything — you just decide if the offer works for you.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS: Clean. Only name fix needed. ✅]</b></p>

<h2>Ad #4 – Failed to Sell with Agent</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> Did you list your land with a real estate agent 6+ months ago and still no serious offers?</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> You're not imagining it — vacant land is harder to sell than houses.</p>
<p>Most agents focus on homes. Most buyers need financing. And most land listings sit... and sit... and sit — while you keep paying taxes and waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>If your land has been on the market with little to no activity, it might be time for a different approach.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS — ADD after "it might be time for a different approach":]</b><br><i>"Your land hasn't lost value — it just needs the right buyer. And right now, builders are actively looking for parcels in growing markets."</i></p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly — no listings, no showings, no waiting for a buyer who may never come.</p>
<p>We're not a traditional real estate company. We focus exclusively on vacant land, and we work with a network of builders and developers who are actively looking for parcels.</p>
<p>That means we can make you a real cash offer based on actual market demand — not just hope someone stumbles across your listing.</p>
<p>Within 48 hours, you'll have a written offer. If it works for you, we can close in as few as 14 days.</p>
<p>No more waiting. No more price reductions. No more agent commissions eating into your sale.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. The offer you accept is the amount you walk away with.</p>

<h2>Ad #5 – Abandoned Development Plans</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> Bought land years ago planning to build — but life happened and now it's just sitting there?</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> Maybe you were going to build your dream home. A weekend cabin. A retirement property.</p>
<p>But plans change. Budgets shift. Priorities evolve.</p>
<p>And now you're holding acres that made sense at the time — but <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">doesn't</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">don't</span> anymore.</p>
<p>The problem is, selling land isn't like selling a house. There's no easy MLS listing. No open houses. Most buyers need financing that takes months to close — if it closes at all.</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly from owners who are ready to move on.</p>
<p>We work with local builders and developers, so we understand what land is actually worth based on current demand.</p>
<p>You don't need to clear it. You don't need to improve it. You don't need to do anything.</p>
<p>We buy land as-is, cover all closing costs, and give you a written cash offer within 48 hours of our first conversation.</p>
<p>If the number works, we close on your timeline — as fast as 14 days.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS — ADD before CTA — Nate's "maxed value" angle:]</b><br><i>"Here's the thing most people don't realize — with new construction booming in many areas, your land may have already hit its peak value. The longer you wait, the more competition from new developments could actually drive your parcel's value down. Now is the time to cash in."</i></p>
<p><b>CTA:</b> If you're holding land you'll never build on, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with Foundational Land Co. We'll review your property and give you a straightforward cash offer — no pressure, no games.</p>

<h2>Ad #6 – Just Want Out (Tired of Holding)</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> Own vacant land that you're just... done with?</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> No big story. No urgent crisis.</p>
<p>You've just owned this land for years — maybe decades — and you're ready to be done with it.</p>
<p>Done paying taxes on it. Done thinking about what to do with it. Done having it sit on your list of "things to deal with someday."</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we get it. And we make selling simple.</p>
<p>We buy vacant land directly from owners — no agents, no listings, no waiting months for a buyer who needs bank financing.</p>
<p>Our team focuses specifically on vacant land. We know the market. We work with builders and developers. And we can give you a fair, written cash offer within 48 hours.</p>
<p>No clearing required. No surveys. No improvements. We buy land exactly as it sits today.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. No commissions. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>The offer you accept is the amount that hits your account at closing.</p>
<p><b>CTA:</b> If you're ready to turn that land into cash and move on, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with Foundational Land Co. No pressure — just a clear offer and a simple path forward.</p>

<h2>Ad #7 – Broad Ad A (Revised Hooks)</h2>
<p><b>Hook 1:</b> Own vacant land you need to sell — whether you inherited it, can't use it, or just want the cash?</p>
<p><b>Hook 2:</b> If you've got land sitting there doing nothing — costing you taxes, time, or mental energy — this is for you.</p>
<p><b>Hook 3:</b> Need to sell your vacant land but don't want to deal with agents, listings, or waiting a year for a buyer?</p>
<p><b>Hook 4:</b> Whether you inherited it, bought it years ago, or just never did anything with it — if you're ready to sell your land, watch this.</p>
<p><b>Hook 5:</b> Holding onto vacant land for any reason and finally ready to turn it into cash?</p>
<p><b>Hook 6:</b> If you own vacant land — 2 acres, 10 acres, whatever — and you're done holding onto it, here's the fastest way to sell.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS — ADD Hook 7:]</b><br><i>"Your land has maxed its value — builders are buying now and this window won't last forever."</i></p>

<p>No clearing required. No surveys. No improvements. We buy land as-is — in whatever condition it's in right now.</p>

<p>We cover all closing costs. There are no commissions. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>The offer you agree to is the exact amount you receive at closing.</p>

<h2>Ad #8 – Broad Ad B (Different Angles)</h2>
<p><b>Hook 1:</b> Before you list your land with an agent, you should see what a direct cash offer looks like.</p>
<p><b>Hook 2:</b> Vacant land doesn't sell like houses — and most agents won't tell you that upfront.</p>
<p><b>Hook 3:</b> If selling your land feels complicated, overwhelming, or like something you keep putting off — this will help you.</p>
<p><b>Hook 4:</b> Want to sell your land without listings, showings, or waiting 12+ months for a buyer who needs bank financing?</p>
<p><b>Hook 5:</b> Own vacant land that's costing you more in taxes and headaches than it's worth? There's a faster way to sell.</p>
<p><b>Hook 6:</b> If your land has been sitting on the market with no serious offers, it's not the land — it's the approach.</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> Selling vacant land isn't like selling a house.</p>
<p>There's no easy MLS process. Most buyers need financing that takes months — if it even closes. And most real estate agents focus on homes, not land.</p>
<p>That's why so many landowners end up stuck — paying taxes year after year on property that just sits there.</p>
<p>At <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">foundation</span> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Foundational</span> Land Co, we take a different approach.</p>
<p>We buy vacant land directly from owners. No agents. No listings. No waiting for a buyer who may never come.</p>
<p>Our team focuses exclusively on land — that's all we do. We work with builders and developers, so we understand what parcels are actually worth based on real demand in today's market.</p>
<p>When you reach out, we'll review your property, walk you through how we determine value, and give you a written cash offer within 48 hours.</p>
<p>No clearing required. No surveys or improvements. We buy land as-is.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. Zero commissions. Zero hidden fees.</p>
<p>The number we agree on is the number you walk away with — and you choose the closing date.</p>

<h2>Ad #9 – Objection-Handling Ad</h2>
<p><b>Hook:</b> If you're thinking about selling your vacant land, there's something you need to know first.</p>
<p><b>Body:</b> Not all land buyers are the same.</p>
<p>The real question isn't just — what's the offer? It's — who's actually behind it?</p>
<p>Are they legitimate? Do they have real capital ready? Is the offer based on actual market research — or just a lowball number hoping you'll bite?</p>
<p>And most importantly… will they actually close — or back out at the last minute?</p>
<p>That's where a lot of landowners run into problems.</p>
<p>You get a mailer or a call. Someone throws out a number. You think you have a deal. Then weeks later — silence. Or they try to renegotiate. Or they disappear entirely.</p>
<p>At Foundational Land Co, we do things differently.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">We buy land directly. We don't wholesale it. We don't flip contracts. When we make you an offer, it's our offer — backed by real capital and real experience.</span></p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>→ Replace with: "We buy land directly. When we make you an offer, it's backed by real capital, real buyer relationships, and real experience. We don't throw out numbers and hope — we do the work upfront."</b></p>
<p>Our team has spent years closing real estate deals and working directly with builders and developers. We understand what land is actually worth based on current demand — not a number pulled from thin air.</p>
<p>Before we make an offer, we analyze your parcel in depth — location, access, terrain, zoning, recent comparable sales — so you know exactly how we arrived at our number.</p>
<p>No guessing. No games. No bait-and-switch.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. There are no commissions. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>The offer you accept is the exact amount you walk away with at closing.</p>
<p>And we close through a reputable local title company — so everything is legally documented and protected.</p>

<h2>Ad #10 – Authentic Owner/Selfie Ad (Nate)</h2>
<p><b>Hook Options (Use ONE per ad):</b></p>
<p>Hook 1: If you own vacant land and you've been putting off selling it — for whatever reason — I want you to hear this.</p>
<p>Hook 2: Hey, if you've got land sitting there that you're not using, not visiting, and not sure what to do with — don't scroll past this.</p>
<p>Hook 3: If you own land that's become more of a burden than an asset, this might be exactly what you need.</p>
<p>Hook 4: If selling your land feels like something you keep pushing to "someday" — let me make this simple for you.</p>
<p>Hook 5: Own vacant land you inherited, bought years ago, or just want to be done with? Here's the fastest way to turn it into cash.</p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>[ATLAS — ADD Hook 6:]</b><br><i>"Your land may have already peaked in value — here's how to know if now is the right time to sell."</i></p>

<p><b>Body (Selfie, Conversational):</b></p>
<p>Hey, I'm Nate with Foundational Land Co.</p>
<p>And if you're watching this, you probably own some vacant land that's been sitting there — maybe for years.</p>
<p>Maybe you inherited it and never really wanted it. Maybe you bought it with plans to build something that never happened. Maybe you're just tired of paying property taxes on land that does nothing for you. Or maybe you've tried to sell it before and got nowhere.</p>
<p>I get it. That's exactly why I started Foundational Land Co.</p>
<p>Here's the deal — <span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">I've spent over five years in real estate investing. I've closed deals, built partnerships, and worked directly with builders and developers who buy land.</span></p>
<p style="color:red;"><b>→ Replace with: "I've spent years closing real estate deals, building partnerships with national builders, and studying land markets across the country. My team and I work directly with the developers and homebuilders who are actively buying land."</b></p>
<p>So I know what land is actually worth. I know what makes a deal close. And I know how frustrating it is when buyers back out, lowball you, or waste your time.</p>
<p>That's not how we operate.</p>
<p>When you reach out to us, you're not talking to a call center or some automated system. You're talking directly to me and my team. We'll take the time to understand your situation, review your property, and give you a real number based on what builders are actually paying for land in your area right now.</p>
<p>No commissions. No closing costs. No hidden fees. No pressure.</p>
<p>Just a straightforward cash offer — and if it works, we close on your timeline.</p>
