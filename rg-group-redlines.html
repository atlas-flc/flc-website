<h2>Ad #1 – Inherited Land</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ Strong overall. Company name fix + one branding upgrade.</p>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> If you inherited land you never asked for — and now you're stuck figuring out what to do with it — this is for you.</p>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> Inherited land comes with a lot you didn't plan for.</p>
<p>Property taxes. Insurance. Figuring out boundaries. Coordinating with family. Maybe even a trip to a property you've never seen and have no use for.</p>
<p>The last thing you need is a long, complicated sale process with no guarantee it even closes.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we specifically help landowners sell vacant parcels — not houses, not rentals — just land.</p>
<p>That's all we do.</p>

<p>Our team takes the time to understand your situation, answer your questions about the property, and walk you through your options at your pace — without pressure to rush into a decision.</p>

<p>Because we work directly with <span class="del">builders and developers</span><span class="add">national homebuilders and regional developers</span>, we know what land is actually worth in today's market — not just what Zillow says.</p>
<span class="comment">Specificity matters. "National homebuilders" signals we're connected to real institutional buyers, not just local flippers.</span>

<p>You won't need to clear the property. No survey required. No improvements or clean-up. We buy land as-is.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs, charge no commissions, and the offer you accept is exactly what you walk away with.</p>

<h2>Ad #2 – Property Tax Burden</h2>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> Paying property taxes every year on land you don't use, don't visit, and have no plans to build on?</p>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> That $500, $1,500, maybe $3,000+ every year isn't building equity. It's not generating income. It's just... gone.</p>
<p>And next year? Same thing.</p>

<p><span class="add">[ADD after "And next year? Same thing."]<br>Meanwhile, active homebuilders in your area are buying land right now — and paying top dollar for it. Your land may be worth significantly more today than it will be a year from now.</span></p>
<span class="comment">This adds urgency without pressure. It's also true — builder demand drives land values up in growth markets, which is where FLC operates.</span>

<p>If you own vacant land and you're tired of watching money disappear into a property that does nothing for you — there's a simpler option.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly from owners like you.</p>
<p>We're not a traditional real estate company. We don't list properties or charge commissions. We specifically focus on helping landowners turn unused parcels into cash — quickly and cleanly.</p>

<p>Our team will analyze your property, explain exactly how we determine our offer based on <span class="del">local builder demand and recent sales</span><span class="add">what active national builders are currently paying for land like yours — not just recent comps, but real buyer demand</span>, and give you a written cash offer within 48 hours.</p>

<p>No clearing required. No surveys. No improvements. We buy land as-is.</p>
<p>You pick the closing date — as soon as 14 days or on your timeline.</p>
<p>And the offer you agree to is the exact amount you receive at closing. No surprises. No fees.</p>

<p><span class="hook">CTA:</span> If you're done paying taxes on land that gives you nothing back, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with Foundational Land Co. We'll review your parcel and show you exactly what it's worth in today's market.</p>

<h2>Ad #3 – Out-of-State Owner</h2>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> <span class="del">Do you Own vacant land but live out of state — and not sure what to do with it?</span><span class="add">Own vacant land out of state that you're not using, not visiting, and not sure what to do with?</span></p>
<span class="comment">Minor cleanup — removes the awkward capitalization and tightens the hook.</span>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> You're not alone.</p>
<p>A lot of landowners hold onto parcels for years thinking they'll eventually do something with them. Build a cabin. Retire there. Pass it down.</p>
<p>But life changes. Plans shift. And now you're paying property taxes on land that's far away — land you can't easily check on, maintain, or even remember the last time you visited.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we work specifically with out-of-state landowners who want a clean, simple exit.</p>
<p>We handle everything remotely. You don't need to visit the property. You don't need to hire someone to clear it or survey it. We buy land as-is — in whatever condition it's in right now.</p>

<p>Our team has <span class="del">years of experience closing land deals and working with builders and developers</span><span class="add">years of experience closing land deals and working directly with national homebuilders — so we know what land is actually worth based on real buyer demand, not estimates</span>. We can give you a realistic cash offer based on actual demand — not guesswork.</p>

<p>Within 48 hours of our first conversation, you'll have a written offer in hand.</p>
<p>No commissions. No closing costs. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>The number we agree on is the number you receive.</p>

<h2>Ad #4 – Failed to Sell with Agent</h2>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> Did you list your land with a real estate agent 6+ months ago and still no serious offers?</p>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> You're not imagining it — vacant land is harder to sell than houses.</p>
<p>Most agents focus on homes. Most buyers need financing. And most land listings sit... and sit... and sit — while you keep paying taxes and waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>If your land has been on the market with little to no activity, it might be time for a different approach.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly — no listings, no showings, no waiting for a buyer who may never come.</p>
<p>We're not a traditional real estate company. We focus exclusively on vacant land, and we work with <span class="del">a network of builders and developers who are actively looking for parcels</span><span class="add">a network of national homebuilders who are actively purchasing land in growth markets right now</span>.</p>
<span class="comment">This is our key differentiator — not just "builders" generically, but national homebuilders actively buying. This signals real institutional buyer relationships, which is why we can move fast and pay fair market value.</span>

<p>That means we can make you a real cash offer based on actual market demand — not just hope someone stumbles across your listing.</p>

<p><span class="add">[ADD after "real cash offer..."]<br>We know what these builders are paying today — and we price our offers accordingly.</span></p>

<p>Within 48 hours, you'll have a written offer. If it works for you, we can close in as few as 14 days.</p>
<p>No more waiting. No more price reductions. No more agent commissions eating into your sale.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. The offer you accept is the amount you walk away with.</p>

<p><span class="hook">CTA:</span> If your land has been sitting on the market with no results, click below to get a free, no-obligation cash offer from Foundational Land Co. We'll give you a clear number and a clear path forward.</p>

<h2>Ad #5 – Abandoned Development Plans</h2>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> Bought land years ago planning to build — but life happened and now it's just sitting there?</p>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> Maybe you were going to build your dream home. A weekend cabin. A retirement property.</p>
<p>But plans change. Budgets shift. Priorities evolve.</p>

<p>And now you're holding acres that made sense at the time — but <span class="del">doesn't</span><span class="add">don't</span> anymore.</p>

<p>The problem is, selling land isn't like selling a house. There's no easy MLS listing. No open houses. Most buyers need financing that takes months to close — if it closes at all.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly from owners who are ready to move on.</p>

<p>We work with <span class="del">local builders and developers</span><span class="add">national homebuilders and regional developers</span>, so we understand what land is actually worth based on current demand.</p>
<span class="comment">Replace "local" with "national" — FLC's edge is relationships with Top 50 homebuilders, not just local contacts. "National" signals credibility and real buying power.</span>

<p>You don't need to clear it. You don't need to improve it. You don't need to do anything.</p>
<p>We buy land as-is, cover all closing costs, and give you a written cash offer within 48 hours of our first conversation.</p>
<p>If the number works, we close on your timeline — as fast as 14 days.</p>

<p><span class="hook">CTA:</span> If you're holding land you'll never build on, click below to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with Foundational Land Co. We'll review your property and give you a straightforward cash offer — no pressure, no games.</p>

<h2>Ad #6 – Just Want Out (Tired of Holding)</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ Clean ad. Company name fix + minor builder specificity.</p>

<p><span class="hook">Hook:</span> Own vacant land that you're just... done with?</p>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span> No big story. No urgent crisis.</p>
<p>You've just owned this land for years — maybe decades — and you're ready to be done with it.</p>

<p><span class="hook">Hook 1:</span> Before you list your land with an agent, you should see what a direct cash offer looks like.</p>

<span class="comment">Slight improvement — makes the insight more specific and compelling. Agents are selling to retail buyers, not builders.</span>

<p><span class="hook">Body:</span></p>
<p>Selling vacant land isn't like selling a house.</p>
<p>There's no easy MLS process. Most buyers need financing that takes months — if it even closes. And most real estate agents focus on homes, not land.</p>

<p>That's where a lot of landowners run into problems.</p>
<p>You get a mailer or a call. Someone throws out a number. You think you have a deal. Then weeks later — silence. Or they try to renegotiate. Or they disappear entirely.</p>

<h2>Ad #10 – Authentic Owner/Selfie Ad</h2>
<p class="section-ok">This is your strongest trust-builder. A few refinements to sharpen the credibility and differentiation.</p>

<p><span class="hook">Hook Options (use ONE):</span></p>
<p>Hook 1: If you own vacant land and you've been putting off selling it — for whatever reason — I want you to hear this.</p>
<p>Hook 2: Hey, if you've got land sitting there that you're not using, not visiting, and not sure what to do with — don't scroll past this.</p>

<p><span class="add">Hook 6 [NEW]: I've spent years building relationships with the national builders who buy land — and I want to tell you what your parcel is actually worth in today's market.</span></p>
<span class="comment">A hook that leads with the builder-relationship credibility. Tests well as an alternative angle for people who are skeptical of typical "cash buyer" pitches.</span>

<p><span class="hook">Body (Selfie, Conversational):</span></p>
<p><span class="del">Hey, I'm Nate with Foundational Land Co.</span><span class="add">Hey — I'm Nate Wish, founder of Foundational Land Co.</span></p>

<p>And if you're watching this, you probably own some vacant land that's been sitting there — maybe for years.</p>
<p>Maybe you inherited it and never really wanted it. Maybe you bought it with plans to build something that never happened. Maybe you're just tired of paying property taxes on land that does nothing for you. Or maybe you've tried to sell it before and got nowhere.</p>
<p>I get it. That's exactly why I started Foundational Land Co.</p>

I know what they're actively buying, what they're paying, and what makes a parcel worth top dollar.</span></p>
<span class="comment">Removed the specific "five years" claim (verify this is accurate before recording). More importantly, repositioned from "I've closed deals" to "I know what national builders are paying" — that's the differentiated insight that sets FLC apart from generic land buyers.</span>

<p>So I know what land is actually worth. I know what makes a deal close. And I know how frustrating it is when buyers back out, lowball you, or waste your time.</p>
<p>That's not how we operate.</p>

<p>When you reach out to us, you're not talking to a call center or some automated system.</p>
<p>You're talking directly to me and my team. We'll take the time to understand your situation, review your property, and give you a real, written cash offer — typically within 48 hours.</p>
<p>No pressure. No games. No bait-and-switch.</p>
<p>We buy land as-is. You don't need to clear it, survey it, or do anything to it.</p>
<p>We cover all closing costs. There are no commissions. No hidden fees.</p>
<p>And we close through a local title company — so everything is clean and protected.</p>

<h2>VSL – Opening</h2>

<p>If you own vacant land you're thinking about selling — whether it's 2 acres or 50 — we can help you sell it fast for cash.</p>

<p>At <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co, we buy vacant land directly from owners like you. No agents. No listings. No waiting months for a buyer who may never show up.</p>
<p>We're not a traditional real estate company. We don't sell houses. We focus exclusively on land — and we've built our entire business around helping landowners turn unused parcels into cash, quickly and simply.</p>
<p>This isn't a rushed phone call or a generic online estimate.</p>
<p>When you work with us, you'll speak directly with our team. We'll take the time to understand your land, your situation, and what you're trying to accomplish — so you can make the right decision for you, even if that decision isn't to sell right now.</p>

<h2>VSL – Who This Is For</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ This section is well written. No changes needed.</p>

<h2>VSL – Our Approach</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ Solid. One refinement:</p>

<p>You're speaking with myself or an expert on our team who understands land — how it's valued, what <span class="del">builders and developers are looking for</span><span class="add">national homebuilders are actively buying right now</span>, and what it takes to close a deal cleanly.</p>

<h2>VSL – Why We're Different</h2>

<p>Here's what sets <span class="del">foundation</span><span class="add">Foundational</span> Land Co apart:</p>
<p>We only buy land. That's all we do.</p>

<p>Because we focus exclusively on vacant parcels, we understand the market in a way most real estate companies don't. We know what land is actually worth based on <span class="del">current builder demand and recent sales — not a Zillow estimate or a generic algorithm.</span><span class="add">what active national homebuilders are currently paying — not a Zillow estimate or a generic algorithm. We track real builder demand, and we price our offers accordingly.</span></p>
<span class="comment">Adds the data-driven, builder-connected angle to the "Why We're Different" section — this is FLC's #1 differentiator and should be front and center here.</span>

<p>We also work directly with <span class="del">builders and developers</span><span class="add">national homebuilders and regional developers</span>, which means we can often move faster and pay more than individual buyers who need bank financing.</p>
<p>And because we're buying the land ourselves — not listing it for you — there are no agents, no commissions, and no waiting for someone else to make a decision.</p>

<h2>VSL – Simple Process</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ Clear and clean. Only a numbering fix needed:</p>

<p>Step 1: Fill out the short form on this page.</p>
<p><span class="del">Then Schedule</span><span class="add">Step 2: Schedule</span> a call with our team. We'll ask a few questions about your land and your situation.</p>
<p>Step 3: We'll review your parcel, analyze the local market, and put together a written cash offer — typically within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Step 4: If the offer works for you, we handle everything from there. You choose the closing date — as fast as 14 days, or longer if you need more time.</p>

<h2>VSL – Condition &amp; Situation Handling</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ No changes.</p>

<h2>VSL – Close + CTA</h2>

<p>Click below. Fill out the short form. And schedule a conversation with our team at Foundational Land Co.</p>
<p>No pressure. No obligation. Just a clear offer and a simple path forward.</p>

<span class="tab-label">TAB 4 — Confirmation Page Video</span>

<h2>Confirmation Page Video Script</h2>
<p class="section-ok">✅ This script is excellent as-is. Clean, trust-building, no-pressure. Minimal changes:</p>

<p>Hey, it's <span class="del">Nate</span><span class="add">Nate Wish, founder of Foundational Land Co</span> — thanks for taking a moment to book your call with us.</p>
<span class="comment">Add last name + title. At this point in the funnel the person booked a call and should know who they're talking to. Professionalism matters.</span>

<p>[...rest of opening unchanged...]</p>

<p>At Foundational Land Co, we focus on one thing: helping landowners sell vacant parcels quickly, fairly, and without the hassle of a traditional real estate process <span class="del">that can take 6-12 months</span><span class="add">that can take 6 to 12 months — if it ever closes at all</span>.</p>
<span class="comment">Small addition that adds punch. Land listings often DON'T close even after a long wait — this speaks directly to that fear.</span>

<p>What makes us different is that <span class="del">we're not a traditional real estate company. We don't sell houses. We don't list properties. We buy land directly — and we do it with a straightforward, no-pressure approach.</span><span class="add">we focus exclusively on vacant land and work directly with national homebuilders to understand what the market will actually bear. We don't guess. We don't run your address through an algorithm. We do real analysis — so when we give you a number, it's grounded in what today's buyers are actually paying.</span></p>
<span class="comment">This is where Foundational Land Co's real differentiation can shine on the confirmation page. The person has already booked — now tell them WHY you're different from every other "cash buyer." The builder-connected, data-driven angle is it.</span>
