        <br>
        <h3>💬 Primary Pitch</h3>
        <p>We offer <strong>5–10X the market value</strong> of land — but we need time to run due diligence and identify the best use. No obligation. No pressure. Just a conversation.</p>

  <!-- PART 1: OPENING -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 1 — Opening</h2>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#666;margin-bottom:16px;font-style:italic;">Warm, conversational. Not salesy. Never read robotically.</p>
    <div class="script-block">
      "Hey [Name], my name is [Your Name], I'm calling on behalf of Foundational Land Co — we're a land acquisition company working in [County Name]. I'll be quick.<br><br>
      We actually found a piece of land you own out there — it's [brief description if available]. Did I catch you at an okay time?"
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      → If <strong>NO:</strong> "No problem — when's a better time to reach you?" → Log callback in GHL.<br>
      → If <strong>YES,</strong> continue:
    </div>
    <div class="script-block">
      "Great. So we specialize in finding the highest and best use for vacant land — and right now we're specifically looking in [County]. We've been able to offer 5 to 10 times what land is typically valued at — because we do the work on our end to figure out what it's really worth to a developer or homebuilder.<br><br>
      I'm not here to make you an offer today. I just want to connect you with one of our land specialists who can walk you through the process, answer your questions, and let you decide if it makes sense. It's a free 15-minute call — no pressure, no obligation.<br><br>
      Would you be open to something like that?"
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: QUALIFYING -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 2 — Qualifying Questions</h2>
    <p style="font-size:13px;color:#666;margin-bottom:16px;font-style:italic;">If they engage, pull 2–3 of these before booking. Log all answers in GHL. Full qual happens on the specialist call.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Just so I can pass the right info to our specialist — do you have a sense of how many acres we're talking about?"</li>
      <li>"Is there road access to the property, or is it a bit more off the beaten path?"</li>
      <li>"How long have you owned it?"</li>
      <li>"Are you paying taxes on it currently?"</li>
      <li>"Have you ever had it appraised, or had any interest from buyers before?"</li>
      <li>"What would make this worth your time to at least explore?"</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 3: BOOKING -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 3 — Booking the Appointment</h2>
    <div class="script-block">
      "Perfect. Our specialist for [County] is [Specialist Name]. They work specifically in this market and can give you a real picture of what your land might be worth under the right conditions.<br><br>
      I can grab you a quick 15-minute slot on their calendar — usually [Day/Time options]. Does something like Tuesday or Thursday work for you?"
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      → Once confirmed: Get name, best callback number, time zone. Log in GHL. Assign to specialist. Set <strong>24-hour reminder task</strong> before appointment.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 4: OBJECTION HANDLING -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Part 4 — Objection Handling</h2>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I'm not interested in selling."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"Totally understand — and honestly, most people we call say the same thing. I'm not asking you to sell anything today.<br><br>Here's the difference with us: most land sits for years and never reaches its full potential. We put in the work to figure out what builders or developers would pay for it — and it's usually significantly higher than what people expect. Sometimes it's eye-opening, sometimes it's not a fit.<br><br>We're just asking for 15 minutes to show you what your land could be worth. If it doesn't make sense, no harm done. Would you be willing to take that call?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"It's not for sale."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"I hear you — I'm not here to pressure you. But can I ask — is that because you have plans for it, or just because no one's ever made it worth your while?<br><br>We work with a lot of landowners who said the same thing, until they found out what the land could actually be worth to the right buyer. Sometimes it changes the conversation.<br><br>Would you be open to at least hearing what it might be worth — no strings attached?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"What are you going to do with it?"</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"Great question. We run due diligence to figure out the highest and best use — that usually means evaluating whether it works for residential development, whether a national homebuilder would have interest, and what the real market value is.<br><br>We don't just flip land at a discount. We do the work to maximize what it's worth, and we share that value with you. That's how we're able to pay 5 to 10 times what the land might look like on paper.<br><br>Our specialist can walk you through exactly what that process looks like on your parcel. Worth 15 minutes?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"How much will you pay me?"</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"That's exactly what the follow-up call is for — we don't throw numbers out before we've done our homework, because we don't want to undervalue your land. That's the whole point.<br><br>Once our specialist reviews the parcel details, they can give you a real range — not just a lowball guess. That call usually takes about 15 minutes. Can we get that on the calendar?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I'll just sell it myself" / "I'll list it with a Realtor."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"You absolutely can — and you might do great. The thing is, most Realtors aren't connected to national homebuilders, and that's where the real money is. Builder-grade land trades at a completely different price point.<br><br>We have those relationships and we do the entitlement legwork that makes the land worth more to them. That's the value we bring.<br><br>Would you at least be willing to hear what that could look like for your parcel before you go that route?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I'm holding it for my kids / family legacy."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"That makes a lot of sense — and we respect that completely. The only thing I'd offer is: sometimes the most valuable thing you can leave your family is the cash value, not the land itself — especially if it's sitting unused.<br><br>Our specialist isn't here to change your mind. But they can give you a clear picture of what that land might be worth to the right buyer, so you can make that decision with real numbers in front of you.<br><br>Is that a conversation worth having — even just to know?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I already talked to someone about this."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"Got it — did that go anywhere, or did it fall through?"</div>
      <div class="note">
        → If it went nowhere: "That's actually pretty common with generic land buyers — they don't do the work to know what it's really worth. We take a different approach. Would you be open to a second opinion from our team?"<br><br>
        → If active negotiations: "Totally understand — we wouldn't want to interfere. Would it be okay to check back in if that doesn't move forward?" → Log: <span class="disp-tag">Active — Follow Up 30 days</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I don't want to deal with developers."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"I understand the hesitation — a lot of landowners have had bad experiences with people who just want to flip it fast and low.<br><br>We're not that. Our model is the opposite: we take time to understand the land, work through the due diligence ourselves, and structure deals that actually work for the seller.<br><br>I think a quick call with our specialist would show you that pretty quickly. Can we find 15 minutes?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"I need to talk to my spouse / partner / family first."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"Of course — absolutely the right move. Let me set up a call for both of you with our specialist. That way you can ask all your questions together and nothing gets lost in translation.<br><br>What day works best for both of you?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">❌</span><span class="obj-title">"Call me back later." / "I'm busy right now."</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"No problem at all. What's the best day and time to reach you?"</div>
      <div class="note">
        → Log exact callback time in GHL. Set reminder task.<br>
        → On follow-up: "Hey [Name], I called a few weeks back about your land in [County] — you asked me to follow up. Did I catch you at a better time?"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection">
      <div class="obj-header"><span class="obj-icon">🚫</span><span class="obj-title">Hard No / Hostile</span></div>
      <div class="script-block">"I completely respect that. Sorry for the interruption — have a great day."</div>
      <div class="note">→ Log <span class="disp-tag">DNC</span> if requested. Otherwise log as <span class="disp-tag">No Interest</span> and move on.</div>
